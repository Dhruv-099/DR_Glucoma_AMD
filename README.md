# DR_Glucoma_AMD Prediction System
A Flask-based web application for predicting eye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) using machine learning models. This project helps medical professionals in diagnosing these conditions based on patient data and medical images.
## Project Overview
This web application allows doctors to input patient data, upload medical images, and predict whether a patient is suffering from Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, or AMD. The system uses machine learning models to analyze the data and provide diagnostic predictions. Additionally, it provides a history of patient records and enables doctors to upload patient photos and other medical information.
## Technologies Used
-Backend: Flask (Python) with Flask-Migrate for database migrations
-Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
-Database: SQLite (can be extended to MySQL/PostgreSQL)
-Machine Learning: CNN and Transfer Learning
